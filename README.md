*A Roman Hand Abacus*

Can you imagine dividing CXVII by IX and carrying down numbers that look more like a cryptogram than an arithmetic problem?
The Romans were saved that torture. They relied on the Chinese abacus, with pebbles as counters, to perform their calculations. 
In fact mathematical operations were performed in Roman times by persons called ‘calculators’. 
They were so named because they used calcule (Latin for pebbles) to add, subtract, multiply and divide.
